# FakeNewsDetection
The aim of this project is to classify news articles as Fake or Real based on the tweets related to the particular article and the profile of the user who sent the tweet. The need for classification arises due to the disinformation that is being spread by fake news, therefore detection of fake news and stopping the spread of fake news is of utmost importance.
